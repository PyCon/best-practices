# PyCon Best Practices

This repository contains best practice guidelines for a number of topics relating to [PyCon](http://us.pycon.org/). It is an effort to document things that help make each PyCon a great conference.

## Contributing

If you have guidelines to contribute, please do one of the following:

* If what you're proposing is widely accepted as the best practice of a particular topic, you can submit a pull request.
* If what you're proposing is one of two ways to handle a particular topic, you should submit an issue or start a discussion thread on the relevant PyCon mailing list. However, if you fully understand and can fairly represent both sides, a pull request may work. *Note: there should be very few of these two-way entries.*
* If there are more ways to handle the topic, there is no best practice for it.
